    <h1>Our mission</h1>
    <img src="images/about-page/UNLOCK-logo.jpeg" alt="UNLOCK Mental Health Logo">
    <p class="about-page">There has always been a stigma around discussing our mental health and wellbeing. According to the WHO, 1 out of every 4 adolescents faces some form of mental illness. Each of us has either struggled,or seen someone dear to us struggle due to mental illness. UNLOCK is a social initiative, which aims to tackle this problem in a healthy manner. Through this platform, we aim to have open discussions and discourse on general issues that a teenager in this day and age is most likely to face. We conduct informative and interactive webinars with mental health professionals and counsellors to spread awareness on common issues.</p>
