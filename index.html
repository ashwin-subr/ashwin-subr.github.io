    <h1>Our mission</h1>
    <img src="images/about-page/UNLOCK-logo.jpeg" alt="UNLOCK Mental Health Logo">
    <p class="about-page">According to the WHO, 1 out of every 4 adolescents faces some form of mental illness. Each of
      us has either struggled, or seen someone dear to us struggle due to mental illness. While mental stability is one
      of the core foundations of a healthy being, it is often overlooked. There has always been a stigma connected to
      discussing our mental health with those around us, especially in Indian society. UNLOCK aims to tackle this
      problem and remove the negative connotation associated with mental health. On this platform, we aim to have an
      open discussion and discourse on general issues that a teenager in this day and age is most likely to face,
      connecting teens with mental health professionals who have more than 20 years of experience.</p>
